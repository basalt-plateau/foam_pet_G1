	<p>
		Most likely every cyte + tissue + organ that makes up this pet 
		is some kind of copyleft or unrestrictive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Therefore, playing with, training, and cloning your pet is most likely 100% legit.
	</p>
	<p>		
		Essentially there is the "Foam Pet Docker Image", 
		"Docker-Debian", "Debian", plus "Components".
		
		The rules of each is detailed below.

	<header>Details</header>
	<section>
		<header>Foam Pet Docker Image</header>

	<section>
		<header>Debian</header>
		<p>
			"Debian" is a mix. https://debian.org
		
			The "Social Contract 1.2" plus the "why_debian" 
			suggested that "Debian" is 100% free,
			and that others may distribute modified derivatives.
			
			https://debian.org/social_contract#guidelines
			https://debian.org/intro/why_debian
			
			"why_debian" has this text: 
			"Debian is made of free and open source software and will always be 100% free. Free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute."
		</p>

	<section>
		<header>PyPI, foam_pet</header>
		<p>
			The "foam_pet" python3 soft is a mix.
		</p>
		<p>
			The "foam_pet" pypi original parts are GPL 3.0.
			"https://pypi.org/project/foam_pet"
		</p>
		<p>
			The "foam_pet" frontend licenses can be found at:
			/habitat/v_env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/foam_pet/sveltnetics_build/frontend-licenses.txt
		</p>
		<p>
			The "foam_pet" pip PyPI licenses can be found within each soft at:
			/habitat/v_env/lib/python3.11/site-packages
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<header>Debian Cytes+Tissues+Organs</header>
		<p>
			Most likely every soft in the debian OS is some kind of copyleft or unrestrictive.

			Once in the distribution, this lists the licensing data of features:
			```
			apt install git
			git clone https://github.com/daald/dpkg-licenses.git
			./dpkg-licenses/dpkg-licenses
			```
